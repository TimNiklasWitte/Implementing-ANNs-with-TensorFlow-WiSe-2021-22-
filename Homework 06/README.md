# IANNWTF - Homework 06

Neural networks based on the ResNet-architecture and on the DenseNet-architecture are trained on the
cifar10 dataset.

## Usage

Run the `Training.py`. Thereafter, a window opens containing a plot which represents the performance of the trainined models.
This plot will be saved in the `result.png` file. 

```bash
python Training.py
```
